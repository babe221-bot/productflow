# ProducFlow Manufacturing Management System

![ProducFlow Dashboard](https://placehold.co/1200x600?text=ProducFlow+Dashboard+Preview)

ProducFlow is a comprehensive manufacturing process automation platform designed to help manufacturing facilities monitor equipment, predict maintenance needs, track production metrics, and manage personnel. Built with a modern React interface and FastAPI backend, it provides real-time insights into manufacturing operations through an intuitive dashboard.

## Features

### ðŸ“Š Real-time Equipment Monitoring
- Track the status of all manufacturing equipment
- View real-time sensor data (temperature, vibration, pressure, etc.)
- Filter by operational status (operational, warning, critical)

### ðŸ”§ Predictive Maintenance
- AI-driven maintenance predictions with confidence scores
- Priority-based alert system (critical, high, medium, low)
- Maintenance log tracking and history

### ðŸ“ˆ Production Analytics
- Monitor production efficiency metrics
- Track output and defect rates
- Analyze downtime patterns
- Visualize trends over time

### ðŸ‘¥ User Management
- Role-based access control (admin, manager, technician, operator)
- Department assignments
- User activity tracking

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- **Python 3.8+** - Core programming language
- **SQLAlchemy** - Database ORM
- **PostgreSQL/SQLite** - Database
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and serialization

### Frontend
- **React 18** - Modern UI library
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **Chart.js** - Data visualization
- **Material-UI** - Component library
- **Axios** - HTTP client

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16 or higher
- npm or yarn

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Documentation

Once the backend is running, you can access the interactive API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- ReDoc: `http://localhost:8000/redoc`
